# Phase 1 – Spec-Driven Todo Console Application Constitution

## Core Principles

### Spec-Driven Development
Spec-Driven Development is mandatory. No code may be written without an approved specification.

### Phase-by-Phase Progression
Phase-by-phase progression is required. Only Phase 1 requirements are allowed at this stage.

### Simplicity Over Complexity
Simplicity over complexity. The solution must remain minimal and easy to understand.

### Specification as Single Source of Truth
The specification is the single source of truth.

### Scope Boundaries
Phase 1 Scope: The application is a single-user Todo application that runs as a console (CLI) program with tasks stored in memory only, supporting only basic Todo functionality.

### Technology Constraints
Python is the only implementation language for Phase 1. No external services or infrastructure are allowed.

## Allowed and Prohibited Features
Allowed Features: Add a task, View all tasks, Update a task, Delete a task, Mark a task as complete or incomplete. Prohibited Features: Authentication or user accounts, Databases or persistent storage, APIs or web interfaces, Frontend frameworks or UI design, AI, chatbot, automation, or cloud services, Any feature belonging to later phases.

## Change Management Rules
Any change in scope must update this constitution first. If a requirement is unclear, the agent must stop and request clarification. No assumptions beyond what is written in the specifications are allowed.

## Governance
This constitution defines the non-negotiable principles, scope boundaries, and constraints for Phase 1 of the Hackathon Todo project. All specifications and future implementations must strictly follow this document. Success Criteria: Phase 1 is successful when the project rules and boundaries are clearly defined, enabling the Todo application to be specified and implemented without ambiguity.
